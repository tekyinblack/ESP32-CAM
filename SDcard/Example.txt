/Example file for robot control  
/    / anything beginning with a blank of a / is ignored on the ESP32, useful for comments
/    Basic Commands are
/    DRIV     the following is a motor drive command (Pico)
/    CMRA     the following is a camera command (Pico)
/    CMRE     the following is a camera command (ESP32)
/    GRIP     the following is a gripper command (Pico)
/    PRFX     the following is a command prefix to be stored. (Pico)
/    FILE     the following is a file to run and return (ESP32)(Startup file is run on startup if present)
/    PASS     the following is a file to pass control to without a return
/    WAIT     robot waits specified length of time before sending ack (Pico)
/    RSET     reset of robot, will also reset esp32 after it has been sent  (Pico)(ESP32)
/    STOP     the robot comes to a controlled stop (Pico)
/    STPE     full emergency stop (Pico)
